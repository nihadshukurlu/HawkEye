# HawkEye: Fraud Detection System

HawkEye is an advanced fraud detection model designed to identify fraudulent transactions with high precision using **XGBoost** and **GPU acceleration**. This repository contains the implementation of HawkEye along with benchmark results.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Optimized Preprocessing:** Efficient feature engineering with categorical encoding, numerical scaling, and high-risk country detection.
- **GPU-Accelerated Training:** Uses **XGBoost** with CUDA support for faster model training.
- **Fraud Detection Analysis:** Provides performance benchmarks, confusion matrix, and business impact metrics.
- **Threshold Optimization:** Finds the best classification threshold using **F1-score**.

## ðŸ“Š Benchmark Results

**Note:** The model is currently in the development process, and its performance is expected to improve with further refinements and data enhancements.

| Metric          | Value  |
|----------------|--------|
| **ROC AUC**    | 0.8723 |
| **Accuracy**   | 97.4%  |
| **F1 Score**   | 0.7815 |
| **Precision**  | 0.7923 |
| **Recall**     | 0.7708 |

ðŸ”¹ **Total Fraudulent Transactions:** 1222  
ðŸ”¹ **Detected Fraudulent Transactions:** 945  
ðŸ”¹ **Detection Rate:** 77.3%  
ðŸ”¹ **False Positive Rate:** 2.5%

## ðŸ›  Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HawkEye-Fraud-Detection.git
$ cd HawkEye-Fraud-Detection
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸ“¡ Dataset
The model is trained using the dataset available at:  
ðŸ”— [Fraudulent E-Commerce Transactions Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shriyashjagtap/fraudulent-e-commerce-transactions/data)

## ðŸš€ Training the Model
To train the model using a dataset:
```bash
$ python src/train_model.py
```
This will process the dataset, train the model, and save it as `deepfraud_model.json`.

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluating the Model
After training, evaluate the model's performance:
```bash
$ python src/evaluate_model.py
```
This script provides classification reports, confusion matrix, and an **ROC curve** visualization.

## ðŸ’¾ Saving & Loading the Model
The trained model is saved as `deepfraud_model.json`. To load the model for predictions:
```python
import xgboost as xgb
model = xgb.Booster()
model.load_model("models/deepfraud_model.json")
```
