# HawkEye: Fraud Detection System

HawkEye is an advanced fraud detection model designed to identify fraudulent transactions with high precision using **XGBoost** and **GPU acceleration**. This repository contains the implementation of HawkEye along with benchmark results.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Optimized Preprocessing:** Efficient feature engineering with categorical encoding, numerical scaling, and high-risk country detection.
- **GPU-Accelerated Training:** Uses **XGBoost** with CUDA support for faster model training.
- **Fraud Detection Analysis:** Provides performance benchmarks, confusion matrix, and business impact metrics.
- **Threshold Optimization:** Finds the best classification threshold using **F1-score**.

## ðŸ“Š Benchmark Results

**Note:** The model is currently in the development process, and its performance is expected to improve with further refinements and data enhancements.
